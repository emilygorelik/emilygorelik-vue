      I am graduate of Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) with a BS in
      Computer Science and a minor in Data Science. I have loved technology for
      as long as I can remember and am always thinking about how I can create
      applications that will benefit myself and others. My career goal is to
      make technology accessible to everyone by designing intuitive webpages
      that are easy to navigate and simple to master.

      When I am not sitting behind my laptop, you can find me tinkering and
      upgrading my 3D printer, tearing up the slopes (weather dependent), or
      playing boardgames.
