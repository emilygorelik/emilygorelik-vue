    <p class="text-xl">Skiing</p>
    <p>
      I have been skiing since I was 6 years old, and to this day there is not
      feeling that matches the wind on your face as you rush down a slope
      nearing speeds of 60 mph. I have been all over the east coast, visiting
      mountains such as Killington, Pico, Lake Placid, Whiteface and so many
      more! In December 2021 I made my first ski trip out west and discovered
      knee-deep powder for the first time.

      After tearing my ACL in December 2022, I was briefly out of commission.
      However, for the 23/24 season was back on snow (with the help of my
      amazing surgical and PT team) and back to crushing it!

    <p class="text-xl">3D Printing</p>
    <p>
      In highschool I used a 3D printer for the first time and ever since I was
      hooked! I bought my own Ender 3 Pro in May 2020 and since then I have
      tinkered non-stop. I have upgraded my printer to have: an all metal
      hotend, a glass buildplate, a silent motherboard, auto bed levelling, and
      even compiled my own firmware that the printer runs on!

      To date my favorite project has been my low-poly geometric chess set. You
      can take a look at that project and my other work

    <p class="text-xl">Traveling</p>
    <p>
      Ever since I was little I have been travelling with my family to visit
      different countries and states. So far, I have been to 9 different
      countries and 22 US states. My longest trip was when I stayed in Prague,
      Czech Republic for two months as part of WPI's study abroad program. It
      was a truly amazing experience and I can't wait to see where else life
      will take me next!
